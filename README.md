# Unity Cheap Runtime Animator
<br/>
A cheap and simple runtime Animator for skeletal meshes.<br/>
Produce Animation clips, states and blending at runtime, NO Editor.<br/>
Why? Because Unity still can't produce runtime AnimationClips that are NOT legacy (which is necessary to use Unity's Mecanim), although promised for over 6 years.
